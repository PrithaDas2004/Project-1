# Project-1
Environmental Sound Classification System using Feature Fusion Method. 
Our project was an Environmental Sound Classification system where we classified different types of sounds—like sirens, dog barks, and rain—into categories. We used a technique called feature fusion, where we combined three types of audio features: MFCCs, spectrograms, and scalograms. These are visual representations of sound. We then used AlexNet, a deep CNN model, to extract patterns from these features and classify the sounds. We achieved an accuracy of around 97% which is much better compared to the accuracy of one feature (Individually MFCC has 89%, Spectrogram has 92%, Scalogram has 89%) showing that our project is quite effective for tough sound classification tasks.
